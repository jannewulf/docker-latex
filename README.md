Mount your volume to the `WORKDIR` and run the build command in the container.

## TODO
- [ ] Create docker-compose file stencil for LaTex projects
- [ ] Use smaller Alpine Linux as base
- [ ] Install not the full TexLive, but only the packages actually needed
- [ ] Handle permissions for files created from within the container
